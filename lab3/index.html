        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>The goal of this lab was to create a local file structure
            and add index.html files.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2> 
        <p>I didn't run into any major problems with this lab since the file structure
            is a clone from a repository provided by the professor.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
